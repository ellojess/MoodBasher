# Mood Basher

## Introduction

Mood Basher is a mobile application working with journal entries and Core Data in iOS devices to help everyday people better manage their emotions and be able to reflect upon their feelings, actions, and daily events. As access to mental health dwindles, there continues to be communities of individuals unable to access it due to finances, immigration statuses, etc. Regardless of circumstances, mental health is important and should be addressed to the best of anyone's capabilities.

Mood Basher was created to be accessible to those who want to bridge the gap between neglecting their emotional well-being in totality and being able to access immediate professional help. This is not a replacement to seeing a real mental health professional if given the opportunity.

Please look at the screen recording below to preview what the journal entry portion of this app looks like:
